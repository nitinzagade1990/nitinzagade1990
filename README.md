### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--

For listening the socket i have used 'tech.gusavila92:java-android-websocket-client:1.2.2' websocket library 

When the Data about city is received at the socket  using the room database library I have stored the  latest city data in the City table along with the that Data is also stored  in the cityhistory    table if the last  data stored in the city history table of particular city is more than 3o second back.


I have used the ViewModel and live data to access the city data and city history data.
Here I have also used the repository pattern to access the data from the  database


When any city data is updated in the database then the data is  updated on the UI also by  using the live data.

When user clicks on the any city data is fetched from the with interval of the 30 seconds and displayed on the screen.

Here I have displayed the MAX 15 interval data in the bar chart.

I started to work on the assignment 9th September and finished on 12 September.
